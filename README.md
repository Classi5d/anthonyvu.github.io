# Mini Maker Mill

**Objective**  
Design and develop a hybrid manufacturing system capable of CNC milling and 3D printing using a dual-head machine on a single axis.

---

## Outcomes & Contributions
- Designed the dual-head assembly in SolidWorks integrating a CNC spindle and 3D printer hotend
- Contributed to machine frame and axis layout
- Conducted FEA simulations to validate 3D-printed structural components
- Participated in subsystem integration and functional testing

---

## Technical Skills
- SolidWorks (CAD, assemblies, FEA)
- Motion system layout
- G-code processing
- Arduino integration

---

## Results
The final prototype demonstrated successful rotational switching between heads and basic motion control.
The design met footprint and strength requirements and was highly rated by faculty.
